            TrackMania Sunrise: Speed-Up! is a beta content mod for TMS.<br>
            The development of the mod on TmSunrise began in February-March of 2021. During this time, a lot of content
            has appeared and been modified in the mod. Initially, development started in late 2018-early 2019.
            At that time, the mod was based on the game TM United 2006 (not Forever), but after the release of the Win10
            patch by KRBDZSKL, the mod immediately switched to TMS.<br>
            In this mod, beta content will be restored and recreated: tracks, skins, interface, sounds, etc.<br>

            Because I participated in the development of tmssu, this is my second mod. It aims to take up the first 7
            environments of TrackMania United. You will tell me that Nadeo has already done it. I took the liberty of
            bringing together all the official vehicle skins from each version of the previous games while implementing
            all the first tracks. Since I couldn't put them in an official way, you can find them in the "Browse"
            section. I had a little bug when creating this mod, which means that the launcher and the game are not
            linked: you have to configure the game via the launcher and play it via the game. For those who are
            impatient to play, download it now at the end of the beta test, for those who prefer to wait a little, a
            second link will arrive around mid-February. Enjoy the game!<br>
